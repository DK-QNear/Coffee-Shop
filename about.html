    <p class="desc">This whole mini project is made by (me)Denish Kerketta on the 3rd Week of March 2022.It is my very first work.Though I've been learing html and css for about 20 days(30 mins daily :)) (theory) and i thought of giving it a practical try so I started doing 
        it and seemed to be fun(25-30hrs) .Hope you dont hate this page :)  </p>
